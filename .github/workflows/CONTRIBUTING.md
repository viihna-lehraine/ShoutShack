Contributions are more than welcome! All that I ask is that you respect the spirit and vision of the project and follow a few simple rules.

### Workflow

#### <b>Please ensure consistency with the existing syntax and format of the project</b>

1. JS files should be vanilla, written using ES Module

2. If you find security vulnerabilities, please alert Viihna Lehraine as soon as possible with as much detail as possible.
